# Acm-BOX
An assistant software of ACM and online judge. New playing methods and game-liked study of algorithm and programming languages.

We want to make it an circle that every new or expertly ACMer/programming languages learner can join.

Just like the LOL/DOTA, we believe that entertainment and the sense of achievement is the importance of study a new things.
May there already has many people want to develop an study software to help green hands realize the pleasure of programming.(may makes an unnecessary move right? lol)

So our project is mainly focus on how to making there more interactivity and joy while people using online judge to study algorithm or just want to do some exercise before Program Contest.
Thinking of that. while you finish an problem on an online judge or other website , and a message push on your desktop about this problem's difficulty/type/correlation algorithm and so on, and your rank in your team or friends will rise.

We planning that , some elements of game , Experience point / Level(may signed by different colors) / equipments may all be join in to our project.

Besides that , we can give statistical data of any user in detal , and our user can search their history submit and learning record . In other words , we can build an index of each problem and each people so that it's easy to make a personal acquisition planning .



This project may include some parts

1, the operation function package in each online judge website.
2, an server side data manage program to support.
3, user side APPs , most of the methods that be involved with user's passwords will be finished local.


And ,it's our first "formal" project , so that many parts of it (such as our English) will not be as "formal" as it would be . So if there are any suggestions plz tell us: reskiping@gmail.com

Of course, this project is public benefit.
